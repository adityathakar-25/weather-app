# My Weather App

Hey there! Welcome to my Weather App project. This was a fun journey in building a clean, good-looking, and easy-to-use website to check the weather. What started as a simple design idea evolved into a fully dynamic and responsive application.

This little app lets you look up the weather for major cities, showing you everything from the current temperature to a full 7-day forecast.


## What's Inside?

I focused on making this project not just functional, but also well-built behind the scenes. Here are some of the key features:

- **From Static to Dynamic** : I converted the app from multiple static HTML pages into a single, smart page that loads all the city data using JavaScript. No more duplicate code!

- **Looks Good Everywhere** : Whether you're on a big desktop screen or your phone, the layout adjusts to fit perfectly.

- **Clean and Tidy Code** : I took the time to refactor the code with professional naming conventions (using BEM for CSS), making it much easier to read and manage.

- **Organized Project** : All the files are neatly sorted into folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, just like a real-world project.


## Tech I Used

This project was built from the ground up using the foundational building blocks of the web:

- HTML5: For the core structure.
- CSS3: For all the styling, backgrounds, and responsive layout (using modern Flexbox).
- Vanilla JavaScript: For all the interactive parts, like searching for a city and dynamically loading all the weather data. No libraries or frameworks, just pure JS!
